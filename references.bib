  abstract = {ANSI escape sequences are a standard for in-band signaling to control cursor location, color, font styling, and other options on video text terminals and terminal emulators. Certain sequences of bytes, most starting with an ASCII escape character and a bracket character, are embedded into text.  The terminal interprets these sequences as commands, rather than text to display verbatim. ANSI sequences were introduced in the 1970s to replace vendor-specific sequences and became widespread in the computer equipment market by the early 1980s. Although hardware text terminals have become increasingly rare in the 21st century, the relevance of the ANSI standard persists because a great majority of terminal emulators and command consoles interpret at least a portion of the ANSI standard.},

  abstract = {We propose a four-way classification of two-dimensional semi-totalistic cellular automata that is different than Wolfram's, based on two questions with yes-or-no answers: do there exist patterns that eventually escape any finite bounding box placed around them? And do there exist patterns that die out completely? If both of these conditions are true, then a cellular automaton rule is likely to support spaceships, small patterns that move and that form the building blocks of many of the more complex patterns that are known for Life. If one or both of these conditions is not true, then there may still be phenomena of interest supported by the given cellular automaton rule, but we will have to look harder for them. Although our classification is very crude, we argue that it is more objective than Wolfram's (due to the greater ease of determining a rigorous answer to these questions), more predictive (as we can classify large groups of rules without observing them individually), and more accurate in focusing attention on rules likely to support patterns with complex behavior. We support these assertions by surveying a number of known cellular automaton rules.},
